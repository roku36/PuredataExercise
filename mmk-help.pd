#X text 27 259 This is an abstraction made for live performance \,
patch testing \, and quick demos. You can switch from MIDI mode to
FREQUENCY mode using the gray toggle. Notes can be transposed two octaves
above and below middle C (full 5-octave range)., f 83;
#X text 27 380 Each key is a canvas placed on top of three bangs. This
walkaround used to recreate the piano keyboard is very delicate. If
you open the abstraction and click on a key (when in Edit-Mode) \,
Pd will select the bang object underneath and not the canvas. Arranging
each key is a very time demanding process so if you ever want to do
that make shure to save a backup patch., f 88;
